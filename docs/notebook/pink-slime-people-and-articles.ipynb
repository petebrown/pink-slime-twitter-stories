    "Metric Media claims its network of websites was \"established to fill the void in community news\".

    "The original purpose of this project was to experiment with SpaCy's named entitity recognition engine to extract the names of public figures mentioned on stories on the homepages of the 156 sites in Metric Media's Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and West Virginia local 'news' networks .\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the process of analyzing the data that resulted from this exercise, my attention was drawn to a curious practice that has not been reported on to date: Many of these websites have started publishing politicians' tweets verbatim and presenting them as news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. The name \"Mike Turner\" was found in ten headlines. On closer inspection, all had the same format: \n",
    ">Ohio U.S. Rep Mike Turner: \\[Tweet\\]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> e.g. [Ohio U.S. Rep Mike Turner: \"This is not just affordable housing, this is respectable housing. Dayton's senior residents deserve...\"](https://greenecotimes.com/stories/629896011-ohio-u-s-rep-mike-turner-this-is-not-just-affordable-housing-this-is-respectable-housing-dayton-s-senior-residents-deserve)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, I sought to dig deeper into the extent of this practice. Using the names of the 61 politicians whose tweets appeared as headlines in my original dataset, I used the \"Organizations in this article\" tags to reach and then scrape the archive of the other articles that had been created from tweets.\n",
    "\n",
